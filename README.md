# FireSmartLamp
It's a Firebase showcase that shows how we can leverage Firebase as the backend of IoT device. 
In this case, I create a Smart Lamp using Raspberry Pi 2. Thanks to Firebase, it's controllable over the internet. 
All I have to do next is creating a web or mobile app, to change some values in Firebase database, and that change will be propagated to and processed by IoT device to do some actions.
